        "description": "Previously, I was a heavy-duty truck driver in the USA and Canada. In 2020, I decided to resume my studies in France to become a web developer. I obtained my RNCP diploma, equivalent to a BAC +2, in web development in 2021, and then a second diploma, equivalent to a BAC +4, in web and mobile web developer design through a 2-year apprenticeship. I am passionate about web development and enjoy learning new technologies. The main technologies I work with include PHP, SQL, Symfony, JavaScript, jQuery, TypeScript, React JS, Next JS, MongoDB and more... I am also a big music fan and play acoustic and electric guitar, as well as the piano. I greatly enjoy working in a team, and for me, development goes beyond just coding; it also involves the user experience. That's why I always strive to step back and put myself in the shoes of a user."
